Henry Müller (b. 1920, Milwaukee, Wisconsin) was a U.S. Army medic in the 3rd Army during World War II. Born to German immigrants, he grew up bilingual, a skill that later set him apart for a covert mission behind enemy lines. Henry served with distinction from the D-Day landings at Normandy through the European campaign, providing life-saving care under fire.  Henry's dedication exemplifies the courage and resourcefulness of those who served in the Allied forces.
