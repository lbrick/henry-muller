Henry Müller (b. 1920, Milwaukee, Wisconsin) was a U.S. Army medic in the 3rd Army during World War II. Born to German immigrants, he grew up bilingual, a skill that later set him apart for a covert mission behind enemy lines. Henry served with distinction from the D-Day landings at Normandy through the European campaign, providing life-saving care under fire.  Henry's dedication exemplifies the courage and resourcefulness of those who served in the Allied forces.

In December 1944, Henry was approached by an OSS officer who had been monitoring his work. He explained that they needed someone like Henry for a special mission behind enemy lines. The mission was to infiltrate Germany under the guise of an organization called the International Cultural Artifact Association (ICAA), which was tasked with examining artifacts looted by the Nazis.

Henry was hesitant at first. he wasn’t a spy or a saboteur—he was a medic. But the officer insisted that his German heritage, fluency in the language, and ability to stay calm under pressure made Henry the ideal candidate.
