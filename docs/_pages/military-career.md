#### D-Day and the Push Through France

Müller landed on Omaha Beach on June 6, 1944, during the Allied invasion of Normandy (D-Day). As part of the 3rd Army's medical unit, he was responsible for treating the wounded on the beach under heavy enemy fire. The chaos and carnage of D-Day left a lasting impact on Müller, but it also hardened his resolve to continue serving. Throughout the Normandy campaign, Müller worked tirelessly to treat his comrades, often under fire, and witnessed the horrors of war firsthand.

Following the successful landings, Müller and the 3rd Army advanced across France. He was present during the battle for Saint-Lô and the subsequent campaigns in Lorraine, where the Allies pushed eastward towards the German border. Müller became known among his peers for his composure and ability to save lives under dire circumstances.

#### Service in Germany and the German Border

By the fall of 1944, Müller and his unit had reached the German border. The brutal winter conditions and constant enemy resistance made the frontline difficult for both soldiers and medical personnel. Müller continued to serve, providing medical care in increasingly hazardous environments.

It was during this period, while stationed near the German border, that Müller was approached by Major John Barnes of the Office of Strategic Services (OSS). Barnes, who had been monitoring Müller’s work as a medic, suggested that Müller’s unique background—his German heritage and fluency in both German and English—made him an ideal candidate for a covert mission behind enemy lines.
