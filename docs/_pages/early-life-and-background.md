Henry Müller was born in 1920 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, to German immigrants, Karl and Liesel Müller. His father, Karl, had been a baker in Stuttgart, Germany, before emigrating to the United States after World War I. His mother, Liesel, was a schoolteacher from a small town near Munich. They sought to escape the socio-political upheaval in post-World War I Germany and find stability in America. Henry grew up in a bilingual household, where his parents maintained their German heritage while embracing American culture.

Müller was raised in a mix of German traditions and American influences. He learned both English and German early on, which would later become an invaluable asset during his military service. He attended public school in Milwaukee, where he excelled in science and sports. Although his parents held reservations about their son's decision to serve in the military during World War II, they ultimately supported his enlistment, driven by a desire to defend the country that had given them refuge.
