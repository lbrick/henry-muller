In 1942, Müller enlisted in the United States Army Medical Corps and was sent to Fort Sam Houston, Texas, for basic medical training. There, he received extensive training in emergency medical procedures, battlefield trauma care, and basic surgery. He was particularly adept at staying calm under pressure, a skill that would prove crucial on the battlefield. Following his training, Müller was assigned to the 3rd Army, which was preparing for the upcoming Allied invasion of Normandy.

The most valuable lesson Henry learned was: calm is contagious. On the battlefield, a medic's ability to project calm could mean the difference between life and death for the men they treated.
