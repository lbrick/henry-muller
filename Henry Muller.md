#### Early Life and Background

Henry Müller was born in 1920 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, to German immigrants, Karl and Liesel Müller. His father, Karl, had been a baker in Stuttgart, Germany, before emigrating to the United States after World War I. His mother, Liesel, was a schoolteacher from a small town near Munich. They sought to escape the socio-political upheaval in post-World War I Germany and find stability in America. Henry grew up in a bilingual household, where his parents maintained their German heritage while embracing American culture.

Müller was raised in a mix of German traditions and American influences. He learned both English and German early on, which would later become an invaluable asset during his military service. He attended public school in Milwaukee, where he excelled in science and sports. Although his parents held reservations about their son's decision to serve in the military during World War II, they ultimately supported his enlistment, driven by a desire to defend the country that had given them refuge.

#### Military Service and Medical Training

In 1942, Müller enlisted in the United States Army Medical Corps and was sent to Fort Sam Houston, Texas, for basic medical training. There, he received extensive training in emergency medical procedures, battlefield trauma care, and basic surgery. He was particularly adept at staying calm under pressure, a skill that would prove crucial on the battlefield. Following his training, Müller was assigned to the 3rd Army, which was preparing for the upcoming Allied invasion of Normandy.

#### D-Day and the Push Through France

Müller landed on Omaha Beach on June 6, 1944, during the Allied invasion of Normandy (D-Day). As part of the 3rd Army's medical unit, he was responsible for treating the wounded on the beach under heavy enemy fire. The chaos and carnage of D-Day left a lasting impact on Müller, but it also hardened his resolve to continue serving. Throughout the Normandy campaign, Müller worked tirelessly to treat his comrades, often under fire, and witnessed the horrors of war firsthand.

Following the successful landings, Müller and the 3rd Army advanced across France. He was present during the battle for Saint-Lô and the subsequent campaigns in Lorraine, where the Allies pushed eastward towards the German border. Müller became known among his peers for his composure and ability to save lives under dire circumstances.

#### Service in Germany and the German Border

By the fall of 1944, Müller and his unit had reached the German border. The brutal winter conditions and constant enemy resistance made the frontline difficult for both soldiers and medical personnel. Müller continued to serve, providing medical care in increasingly hazardous environments.

It was during this period, while stationed near the German border, that Müller was approached by Major John Barnes of the Office of Strategic Services (OSS). Barnes, who had been monitoring Müller’s work as a medic, suggested that Müller’s unique background—his German heritage and fluency in both German and English—made him an ideal candidate for a covert mission behind enemy lines.

#### Selection for the OSS Insurgent Mission

In December 1944, Müller was selected for a high-stakes insurgent mission under the guise of the International Cultural Artifact Association (ICAA), a cultural group purportedly dedicated to studying and preserving German artifacts looted during the war. In reality, the ICAA was a front for a covert OSS operation aimed at infiltrating German territory to gather intelligence, sabotage key Nazi operations, and disrupt enemy morale from within.

Müller’s selection for the mission was based on his fluency in German, his familiarity with German culture, and his extensive experience in high-pressure situations. The OSS believed that his background would allow him to blend into German society and navigate through the complex and dangerous world of Nazi espionage. The mission, which would take him deep into German-held territories, would require him to act as both a medical professional and an intelligence operative.

Müller was briefed about the mission in detail, though specifics were kept classified. The plan involved infiltrating Germany under the cover of academic research, retrieving valuable intelligence, and disrupting Nazi efforts in critical areas. The mission was scheduled for early 1945.

#### Personal Life and Legacy

Henry Müller remains one of the many unsung heroes of World War II, whose actions in the field helped save countless lives. While his work as a medic has been widely praised, his selection for the covert OSS mission demonstrates his adaptability and courage in the face of overwhelming odds. As of the latest known records, his contributions to the Allied effort remain part of the larger narrative of those who served in World War II and are remembered for their sacrifices.
